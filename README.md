Frontend Mentor Project. For this project i was tasked with building a website that would allow users to generate random advice from the slip API. I created the layout using a combination of HTML and CSS whilst using Figma as a reference for the intended mobile and desktop designs. I used JavaScript to create the API call and to display the advice on the page. I used the following technologies in this project:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript 
4. Slip API
5. Postman Agent
6 Figma
